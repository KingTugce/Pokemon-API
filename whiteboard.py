# You must implement a function that returns the difference between the biggest and the smallest value in a list(lst) received as parameter.

# The list(lst) contains integers, which means it may contain some negative numbers.

# If the list is empty or contains a single element, return 0.

# The list(lst) is not sorted.

# max_diff([1, 2, 3, 4]) # return 3, because 4 - 1 == 3
# max_diff([1, 2, 3, -4]) # return 7, because 3 - (-4) == 7
